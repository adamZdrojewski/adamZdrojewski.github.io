                            <p>Fadebot is a bot for Discord that plays music inside of a voice channel.  The cool thing about this music bot though is that it uses a website to request songs and manage the queue.  The website also has a playlist editor so that the bot can auto-dj.  I designed and wrote the website portion of the project using JavaScript and a few PHP scripts.  This interacted with a Google Firestore database.</p>

                            <p>ZHub is a website that me and my family use to keep track of our calendars and to-do lists.  The general concept and layout of the site is based off of the Carnival Hub App from the cruise line.  This was the first site that I made using Vue.js.  The website also communicates with a Google Firestore database.</p>

                            <p>Jungle Cruise is a mini-game that I wrote that is based off of the Jungle Cruise board game from Disney.  I re-designed the game to work in a similar style to the ones made by Jackbox Games.  I wrote the game in JavaScript and used Electron to make it into a windows app.  That program consisted of the main display screen and it also ran an http server to serve the mobile website to the players.  Finally, I tied it all together with socket.io so that the mobile devices could communicate with the socket.io server running on the main program.</p>
